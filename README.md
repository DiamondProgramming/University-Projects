# 📚 University-Projects 📚

---

Welcome to `University-Projects`! This repository serves as a collection of my academic projects, assignments, and coursework completed during my university studies in data science. Here, you'll find implementations of concepts learned in class, solutions to programming assignments, and larger project works.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main objectives of this repository are:

* **Document academic progress** and showcase coursework.
* **Apply theoretical knowledge** to practical implementations.
* **Explore course-specific topics** in depth, such as:
    * **Algorithms and Data Structures**
    * **Machine Learning** and Artificial Intelligence
    * **Database Systems**
    * **Software Engineering** principles
    * **Web and Application Development**
    * **Operating Systems**
    * **Computer Networks**
    * ...and other core computer science subjects!
* **Build a portfolio** of university-level work for future reference or sharing.
* **Reinforce learning** through code, reports, and documentation.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Projects are organized into folders, typically named after the course code, name, or semester (e.g., `CS101-Intro-to-Programming`, `DataScience-ML-Project`). Each project folder will ideally contain:

* **Source Code:** The main implementation files.
* **`README.md`:** A dedicated readme with details on the assignment, approach, technologies used, how to run it, and key takeaways or challenges faced.
* **`requirements.txt` (if applicable):** Dependencies for Python-based projects.
* **Reports/Documents (if applicable):** Any written reports, presentations, or design documents submitted for the course.
* **Screenshots/Gifs (if applicable):** Visual demonstrations of the project output.

## ✨ Projects

Here are some examples of the types of projects included (based on typical computer science coursework):

* **Introductory Programming:** Basic scripts and applications in languages like Python, Java, or C++.
* **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Implementations of sorting, searching, trees, graphs, etc.
* **Machine Learning Assignments:** Models for prediction, classification, clustering using libraries like scikit-learn.
* **Database Projects:** SQL queries, schema designs, or applications with PostgreSQL/MySQL.
* **Web Development:** Full-stack or frontend/backend assignments using frameworks like Flask, Django, or React.
* **Software Engineering:** Group or individual projects focusing on design patterns, testing, and version control.

As I progress through my courses, more projects will be added!
