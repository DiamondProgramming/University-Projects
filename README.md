# 📚 University-Projects 📚

---

Welcome to `University-Projects`! This repository is a collection of my academic projects, assignments, and coursework from my **BSc in Data Science**. It showcases practical implementations of concepts learned across various courses in data science and related fields.

Repository description: *Projects completed as part of coursework for my BSc Data Science*

## 🎯 Purpose

The main objectives of this repository are:

* **Document academic progress** and showcase coursework for my BSc Data Science degree.
* **Apply theoretical knowledge** to practical implementations.
* **Explore course-specific topics** in depth, such as:
    * **Data Analysis** and Visualization
    * **Machine Learning** and Artificial Intelligence
    * **Statistics** and Probability
    * **Database Systems** and Big Data
    * **Programming** for Data Science
    * **Algorithms** and Data Structures
    * **Data Ethics** and Professional Practices
    * ...and other core data science subjects!
* **Build a portfolio** of university-level work for future reference or sharing.
* **Reinforce learning** through code, reports, and documentation.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Projects are organized into folders, typically named after the course or project title (e.g., `Diabetes Data Analytics and Machine Learning`). Each project folder will ideally contain:

* **Source Code:** The main implementation files (often Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, etc.).
* **`README.md`:** A dedicated readme with details on the assignment, approach, technologies used, how to run it, and key takeaways or challenges faced.
* **`requirements.txt` (if applicable):** Dependencies for Python-based projects.
* **Reports/Documents (if applicable):** Any written reports, presentations, or design documents submitted for the course.
* **Screenshots/Gifs/Datasets (if applicable):** Visual demonstrations, data files, or output examples.

As more courses are completed, additional folders will be added!

## ✨ Projects

Current and upcoming project types in this repository (tailored to BSc Data Science coursework):

* **Data Analytics Projects:** Exploratory analysis, cleaning, and insights from real-world datasets (e.g., diabetes health indicators).
* **Machine Learning Assignments:** Building and evaluating models for prediction, classification, regression, and clustering.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and inferential statistics.
* **Visualization Dashboards:** Interactive plots and reports using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.
* **Big Data & Databases:** Working with large datasets, SQL queries, and NoSQL systems.
* **End-to-End Data Science Projects:** From data collection to modeling and deployment basics.

More projects will be added as I progress through the program!
